# Tomaszal's CS:GO configuration

This is my CS:GO config that contains numerous quality-of-life improvements.

***TODO**: Add more details.*

## Installation

To install this config navigate to the CS:GO local userdata folder in Steam:

```
<Steam>/userdata/<SteamID>/730/local/
```

Remove the `cfg` folder (if it's there) and clone this git repository with this command: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Tomaszal/csgo-config.git cfg
```

Alternatively you could also download this repository and unarchive it.

## Launch options

To set launch options go to:

```
Steam > Library > Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (right-click) > Properties > Set Launch Options...
```

Remove all current options and enter these:

```
-novid -nojoy
```
